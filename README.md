This project aims to develop a full-stack Java and React application for an ATM interface. Here's the breakdown of user stories, controllers, models, relationships, and the required files:

### User Stories:

*As a user, I want to:*

- Withdraw cash in specific denominations.
- Deposit cash.
- Transfer funds between my accounts.
- View my transaction history.
- Change my PIN.
- Logout of the system.

### Project Structure

The project is structured into two main components: the Java backend and the React frontend.

#### Java Backend

- The backend is developed using Spring Boot.
- It provides RESTful API endpoints to handle ATM functionalities.
- Data persistence is achieved using Spring Data JPA with Hibernate.
- Additional dependencies include Spring Security for authentication and authorization.

#### React Frontend

- The frontend is developed using React.
- It interacts with the backend through API calls to perform ATM operations.
- The user interface is designed to provide a seamless and intuitive experience.
- Components are organized based on ATM functionalities.
